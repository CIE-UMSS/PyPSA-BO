check all jobs enabled in the config/snakemake file:
	snakemake --dag solve_all_networks --forceall -n

Update the config file and save it to a dot file:
	snakemake --dag solve_all_networks --forceall > workflow.dot

Open and delete the first lines in the file (usually it creates some registration linked to the solver)
	the worklfow.dot file should start with the line "diagrpah snakemake_dag {"

Create a png file based on the workflow.dot file:
	dot workflow.dot -Tpng -o workflow.png
